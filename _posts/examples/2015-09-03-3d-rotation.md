# 3D Rotation

The [rotation](/properties/#rotation) property supports rotation in [three dimensions](/concepts/#3d). The first story defines three [text](/models/#&middot;-text-item) items that will each rotate around one of the dimensions.

A default [class](/properties/#class) is used to define properties common to all _text_ items.  The [transform origin](/properties/#transform-origin) property bumps the origin down <samp class="number">7</samp> percent to compensate for the vertical centering of the font glyphs. Each text item animates for <samp class="number">3</samp> seconds, each waiting for the prior one by use of the [delay](/properties/#delay) property.

# Perspective

The vanishing point is in the center of the page. To demonstrate perspective with 3D animation, the second story moves the _X_ and _Y_ text items around in a circular pattern.  The second story can be seen by clicking the button labeled __2__ underneath the editor.

The text items are placed in nested [layers](/models/#&middot;-layer-item). The first rotates with a rotation radius of <samp class="number">20</samp> percent of the page's width.  The outer layer has a single inner layer that is simply rotating in the opposite direction.  The text items are children of the inner layer. The layers rotate three times, ten seconds each. The text items rotate ten times, three seconds each.  All use a linear [ease](/concepts/#eases) for seamless, constant rotation.
