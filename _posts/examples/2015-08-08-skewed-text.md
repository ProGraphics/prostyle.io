# Skewed Text
The [skew](/properties/#skew) property slants an item horizontally in one direction or the other based on an angle.  Positive angles slant up to the left. Negative numbers slant up to the right.

This example uses a [yoyo animation](/properties/#animation) to skew the text back and forth between <samp class="number">-20</samp> and <samp class="number">20</samp> degrees.

### Vertical Skewing
The second story can be viewed by clicking the button labeled __2__ under the editor. Vertical skewing is accomplished by skewing and rotating at about the same angle.

### Up and Down
The third story shows that combining the skew and rotation properties can result in some interesting animation.
