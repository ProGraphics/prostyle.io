# Color Cycling

This example initializes the [text color](/properties/#text-color) property of a [text](/models/#&middot;-text-item) item and then cycles through different colors. It uses a single [script](/concepts/#scripts) with three actions. The actions execute in order, each animating the text to a new color over 3 seconds. Different [color string](/concepts/#color) formats are used for demonstration purposes.
