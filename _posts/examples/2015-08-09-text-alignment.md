# Text Align
The [textAlign](/properties/#text-align) property provides support for traditional text alignment.

The text may be aligned left, right, center or justified within a paragraph.  The change may be scripted, as this demonstration shows, but the value cannot be animated over time. It changes instantly.

Alternatively, the [anchor](/properties/#anchor) property may be used for smoothly animated alignment if items.
