# Corners

The corners property is used to create rounded corners.  When a number is given, it represents the radius of the circle as a percentage of the _height_ of the container (page).

This example animates between five different configurations over 10 seconds.

# The first configuration sets all four corners to 15%.
# The second one sets all four differently.  The first number corresponds to the top-left corner, then top-right, bottom-right and then bottom-left.
