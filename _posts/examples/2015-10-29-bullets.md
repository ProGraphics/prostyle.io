# Bullets

The [bullets](/properties/#bullets) property can be used to add bullet icons to individual lines. It is only available for _text lines_, using the <code>linesInit</code> and <code>lineActions</code> entries.

This example demonstrates how to change the bullet icon on each line, and stagger the change. Since there are five lines of text and the change is staggered by <samp class="number">0.2</samp> seconds, it takes a total of one second to switch to each bullet icon. The value <samp class="boolean">false</samp> removes the bullets.
