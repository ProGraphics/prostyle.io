# Simple Scaling
The [scale](/properties/#scale) property quickly resizes an item. The affect may look similar to changing the <code>z</code> value with the [posiiton](/properties/#position) property but scaled items are just mad larger that the same _z_ position.

Try changing the scale value from <samp class="number">50</samp> to <samp class="number">0</samp>.

See [Size vs. Scale](/concepts/#size-vs.-scale) to understand the tradeoffs that can be made between the two.
