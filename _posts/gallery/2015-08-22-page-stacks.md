# Page Stacks

[stackFlow](/models/#&middot;-stack-flow) is a premium extension that comes with [ProStyle Plus](/plus/). Pages are organized in stacks. Each page starts on a _future stack_, becomes the _current page_, and ends up on a _past stack_. The extension has a default stack configuration, but can be changed to get different effects.


### Default Configuration

The first story has seven pages, each with just one [text item](/models/#&middot;-text-item).  The <code>flowType</code> entry tells ProStyle to use the <samp class="string">"stack"</samp> flow.
