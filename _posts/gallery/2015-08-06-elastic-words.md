# Elastic Words

Each word in the text is styled as a panel and animated into place.  [Padding](/properties/#padding) is added to lines _and_ words, so they are all evenly separated. The text is word wrapped using the [text width](/properties/#text-width) property.

A _gate swing_ effect is created using the [rotation](/properties/#rotation) and [transform orgin](/properties/#transform-origin) properties together.  

### Exit Effect

The second story can be viewed by clicking the button labeled __2__ under the editor. It adds additional animation which fades the words away.
