# Pro

This animation configures the canvas with a background color and rounded corners.  A single text item is animated back and forth.

This animation demonstrates shortcutting. Only a single <code>item</code> entry is needed since there is only one item, on one page, with the default page flow (simple).

### Configuration

The default item type is <samp>"text"</samp> so the <code>itemType</code> entry is also omitted. An <code>init</code> entry is used to initialize properties. The font size is set to 35% of the height of the canvas, the text color is set to <samp>"white"</samp> and the center of the text is positioned on the x axis at the center of the canvas minus 25% of the canvas' width.

### Animation

There is only one script, which contains two actions.  Therefore, the <code>scripts</code> entry is omitted and replaced with <code>actions</code>. The array contains the actions. Each action animates the position over two seconds.
