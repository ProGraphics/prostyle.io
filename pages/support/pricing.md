    <p class="teaser b60" markdown="1">We strive to make ProStyle accessible to as many people as possible.  To that end, we do not charge for the most common way it is used; placing prebuilt animations into web pages and web applications. We fund further development and support by charging for the less common scenario where the integrations dynamically generate animations, and by selling [ProStyle Plus](/plus/), a set of premium extensions.</p>

      <dd class="accordion-navigation">
        <a href="#panel1" class="noline"><span class="iconfont"></span>Why not make it open source?</a>
        <div id="panel1" class="content">
          <p>We firmly believe this licensing model delivers a superior end product and serves the community better. Open source products with no funding mechanism typically stagnate and become obsolete.</p>
          <p>Our goal is to keep ProStyle very accessible while putting in place a mechanism that funds continued support, innovation, and bug fixes.</p>

        <a href="#panel2" class="noline"><span class="iconfont"></span>Can I sell animations?</a>
        <div id="panel2" class="content">
          <p>Absolutely!  Unleash your creativity. Give them away. Sell them. Whatever you want. Your customer will be able to use the <em>free</em> license to display your work as long as the animation JSON goes unchanged or only hand-written changes are made.</p>
          <p>You may distribute ProStyle as part of your work product so long as the source files are unaltered (including copyright notices therein). Your customers will be subject to ProStyle's pricing and licensing.</p>

        <a href="#panel3" class="noline"><span class="iconfont"></span>Is there an API?</a>
        <div id="panel3" class="content">
          <p>ProStyle is very extensible. You can create your own <a href="/extensions/">extensions</a>.</p>
          <p>Also, you can programmatically generate animations by emitting the story JSON per our <em>Dynamic Stories</em> licensing.</p>
          <p>If you need to program animations with finely-grained control, we recommend using the <a href="http://greensock.com/gsap">Greensock Animation Platform</a>.</p>

        <div id="panel9" class="content">
          <p>Sure. If the plugin only allows the user to paste in previously written stories or to hand-edit them, you and your users can use the free <em>Static Stories</em> license. If your plugin will provide tooling that helps the user generate the JSON, you will need the <em>Dynamic Stories</em> license.</p>
          <p>You may say that the plugin is powered by ProStyle, but you may not indicate that it is an official plugin without express consent from Pro Graphics, Inc.</p>
