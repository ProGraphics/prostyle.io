## [Concepts](/concepts/)

There are a handful of _concepts_ that will help you get started writing your own ProStyle animated stories.  Keep these in mind when crafting your stories to help you unlock your creativity.

## [Models](/models/)

Models are the _things_ that you have in your stories, such as the canvas, pages, and individual items like text, images or charts. 

## [Properties](/properties/)

Properties are features, such as the color of text or the rotation of an image.  Property values can be changed, and animated over time.

## [Controllers](/controllers/)

Controllers enable user interaction and can provide visual feedback of the state of the _player_.

## [Extensions](/extensions/)

ProStyle is designed to be entensible.  You can write your own extensions or select from prebuilt ones, such as those that come with [ProStyle Plus](/plus/).
