#### Concepts

There are a handful of _concepts_ that will help you get started writing your own ProStyle animated stories.  Keep these in mind when crafting your stories to help you unlock your creativity. [More.](/concepts/)


#### Models

Models are the _things_ that you have in your stories, such as the canvas, pages, and individual items like text, images or charts. [More.](/models/)


#### Properties

Properties are features, such as the color of text or the rotation of an image.  Property values can be changed, and animated over time. [More.](/properties/)



#### Controllers

Controllers enable user interaction and can provide visual feedback of the state of the _player_. [More.](/controllers/)



#### Extensions

ProStyle is designed to be entensible.  You can write your own extensions or select from prebuilt ones, such as those that come with [ProStyle Plus](/plus/).
