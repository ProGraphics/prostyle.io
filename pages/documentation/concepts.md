## Overview
{: class='t0'}

<div style="display:inline-block;max-width:160px;float:right;margin:0.5em 0 0 0.5em">{% include ad.html %}</div>
Pro Motion animations are referred to as _stories_. They are translated from [JSON](#){:data-toc='json'} into _web content_ and a _timeline_. The [timeline](#){:data-toc='timeline-and-steps'} instructs how the content's [properties](#){:data-toc='properties'} are changed over time.

## Story
Each story is composed of a _canvas_, a _frame_, and one or more _flows_. Each flow contains one or more _pages_, and each page contains one or more _items_.

### Model Objects
Models are the _things_ that exist within the story. They physically exist as web content and have properties that define their appearance. The properties may be animated with scripts.

| Model | Description  |
|:-:|---|
| Canvas | The canvas is the drawing surface of the animation.  It is mapped to a single <code>div</code> element or the <code>body</code> element of an HTML page. The HTML element might be any rectangular size. For example, a body tag stretches to fit the browser window. There is only one canvas. |
| Frame  | The frame is centered within and stretches to fit the canvas, minus any padding. However, unlike the canvas, the frame always maintains a configured aspect ratio. There is only one frame. |
| Flows  | Flows control page-to-page animation, such as page stacks, carousels, etc. Each flow contains one or more pages. |
| Pages  | Pages contain the item content. The timeline navigates from page to page. Pages are analogous to slides in old-school presentation software. |
| Items  | Items are the core visuals, such as text, images, and charts. |


### Structure
All story documents follow the same general structure. See if you can recognize the pattern in the following example. Just about everything is optional.

<div class="row">
  <div class="small-12 medium-10 medium-centered large-8 columns">
		{% include alert text="If the following looks like gibberish, don't fret.  It's only JSON, which you can <a href='#json'>learn about here</a>." %}
	</div>
</div>

<pre data-ace="readonly" style="width:100%;">{
  canvas: {
    setup: {...},
    init: {..}
  },
  frame: {
    setup: {...},
    init: {...}
  },
  flows: [
    {
      flowType: "...",
      setup: {...},
      pages: [
        {
          init: {...},
          scripts: [
            {
              scriptType: "...",
              actions: [{...}, {...}]
            },
            {...}
          ],
          canvasScripts: [...],
          frameScripts: [...],
          items: [
            {
              itemType:"...",
              init: {...},
              scripts: [...]
            },
            {...}
          ]
        },
        {...}
      ],
    }
  ]
}</pre>

The above might look a bit complicated.  If you study it for a moment, though, youâ€™ll see a pattern.  Each model object can have [setup, properties, or both](#){:data-toc='setup-vs.-properties'}.  Properties are initialized with <code>init</code>.

Pages and items may have scripts. Each script has actions such as to animate property changes. The canvas and frame may also have scripts, but they are triggered in conjunction with a page using <code>canvasScripts</code> and <code>frameScripts</code>. For example, you might decide to change the canvas background when a certain page is displayed.
